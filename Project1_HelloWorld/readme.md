# PROJECT 1: HelloWorld (Basic Version)
*Hello World: setup Android Studio IDE, compile first app that displays just a hello world text on the screen.*

- Android Studio is correctly set up,
- the project can be synchronized with Gradle,
- the application can be compiled and executed on an emulator/device,
- a simple text (**"Hello World!"**) is displayed on the screen.

## 🎄 Summary

In this basic assignment, I created a new Android project using the **Empty Activity (Jetpack Compose)** template in Android Studio, completed the **Gradle synchronization**, and successfully **built and ran** the application on an Android emulator. The final result is a single-screen app that displays the text **"Hello World!"**, confirming that the development environment and build pipeline are correctly configured.
